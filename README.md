This project is an effort to right the wrong of Grobo rug-pulling their entire communtity and leave their customers with $1,200 paper weights.
I have cloned the entire my.grobo.io page, including the recipies. Next step is to try and reverse engineer the website and create something that will allow users to continue using their Grobos.
